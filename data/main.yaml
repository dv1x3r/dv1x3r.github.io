      I can spin up and manage cloud linux servers, containerize applications, and write code using nvim and helix.

      I love working in the terminal overall. I prefer to old school system'd my projects on a Linux VPS.
      It allows me to keep my costs in check and maintain discipline, instead of going serverless and
      [scaling into bankruptcy](https://eieio.games/essays/scaling-one-million-checkboxes/#bound-my-costs).
